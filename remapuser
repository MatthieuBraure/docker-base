# USAGE: /sbin/remapuser USERNAME NEW-UID NEW-GUID comands ....
#
# (*) remaps user USERNAME to given UID/GID
# (*) remaps all files belonging to the old group and user id to match the new 
#     settings
# (*) executes /sbin/setuser USERNAME with rest of commandline params
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: 
#
# This script calls usermod which changes files in the home directory with the 
# old uid AUTOMATICALLY to the new uid. Be aware that when you mount an external
# volume there and it matches the old uid (9999) this files will be changed!
#
# Lesson learned: NEVER ever use external mount points below $HOME
